## Description
“There is a problem with how real estate is being done. People don't want to awkwardly haggle with their realtor over the pricing of their services. Why shouldn't people be able to choose the marketing plan they want while getting excellent service and transparency? This website is to help people order my services and pick out the marketing plan right for them. It is also meant to help home buyers order services from me online.” - Cole Tanner

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
